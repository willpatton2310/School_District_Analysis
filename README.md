# Module 4 Challenge - (School_District_Analysis)
## Objective
Our task was to take test data from several types of schools and prepare an evaluation of their performance.
We were originally given one set of data, however there was some concern that there may have been some fraudulent scores submitted for evaluation.
Our task then became to analyze the schools with both data sets to see if there were any clear evidence of fraud.

## Analyis
Utilizing Python, we downloaded the data an ran two rounds of analysis.  First, all schools and grades were included.  Then, we were asked to remove
the 9th grade scores from Thomas High School, as this was the source of the suspected foul play.
